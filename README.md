# NVS Electronic Controller



A configurable, ready-to-manufacture controller hardware design for use in low-cost CPAP ventilators. It incorporates an operator interface, pressure-sensing mechanism, and control of arbitrary actuators. It is powered by a standard 5V USB power bank or cell-phone charger.

This design is intended to accelerate development efforts towards the National Ventilator Project (NVP). Use directly as a ventilator controller or monitor, use with modification, or use as a reference design. 


Inside this repository are the following resources:

1. An overview of the controller hardware design (this page)
2. Printed circuit boards (PCB) designs: Gerber files and EAGLE project
3. Bill of Materials
- <u>Firmware not included</u> (sample firmware for 8-bit PIC microcontrollers is on its way)




## Ready for immediate manufacture

- Implemented on standard, 2-layer PCB.
-- Abudant local capability to make these kinds of boards.
- Relies mostly on simple, widely-available components which can be found in any hobby store or lab.
- Clear, user-friendly, multi-lingual labelling of controls on PCB.
-- Enclosure can initially be entirely omitted.

## Configurable by implementer

- Allowance for either through-hole (THT) or surface-mount (SMT) variants for most components - use whichever is easier/quicker.
-- SMT-only design for volume manufacture is in the pipeline.
- Breakouts allow for use with any arbitrary microcontroller or external electronics.
-- On-PCB 28-pin DIL mounting point for PIC16F15354 or many others.

# Overview of design


## Monitor-only vs. Monitor and control

This design is available in two different flavours:

- Monitor only: Visually reports airway pressure, with auditory pressure loss and over-pressure alarms.

![Monitor onlyoverview](/nvp_controller_overview_monitor_only.png)

- Monitor and control: Simple push-button input of target FiO<sub>2</sub> and airway pressure, actuator control

# Sub-system overview



## Microcontroller


## Pressure sensing


## LED displays

7-segment provide feedback for the following metrics:

1. Desired inspired oxygen proportion (FiO<sub>2</sub>)
2. Desired airway pressure
3. Current airway pressure

Additionally, discrete LEDs can be used to 


LEDs are arranged in vertical rows, placed within clearly-deliniated labelled sections. Each LED is laballed with its discrete value. This eliminates the need for any seperate labelling or faceplate.

Provision is made on the PCB for either 5mm through-hole, 3mm through-hole or 0603 (1608 metric) surface-mount LEDs.


### 1. Desired inspired oxygen propoprtion

The NVS specification calls for inspired oxygen proportion (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to be set in increments of 10% over a range of 30% to 100%. An array of 8 LEDs are installed for this purpose.

Feedback for actual current FiO<sub>2</sub> is not considered.


### 2. Desired airway pressure

The NVS specification calls for airway pressure to be set within a range of 5 to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Arbitrary intervals of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 results in 5 LEDs.

### 3. Actual current airway pressure

The NVS specification calls for airway pressure to be set within a range of 5 to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and for a maximum over-pressure of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>0. A pressure monitoring range of 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 to 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 is considered. A 9-LED array provides feedback in increments of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>0.


## Actuators

Provision is made for control of actuators with the intent of being non-prescriptive in mechanical design. Three actuators are accomodated:

1. Airway pressure control actuator
2. FiO<sub>2</sub> actuator
3. Flow control actuator


Actuator outputs can be configured in one of two modes:

- Positive/negative DC, intended for on-off solenoid actuation.
- Stepper motor control, intended for control valve actuation.


## Power

Input power is provided by a USB power bank or cell-phone charger. Most end users are expected to have at least one of these consumer-grade devices already in their possession, and failing this, they are cheaply and easily sourced elsewhere.


A consumer-grade USB supply eliminates the need for on-board AC/DC conversion or 5V voltage regulation. Two configurations are possible:

1. USB charger only
2. USB charger, connected to USB power bank

A back-up power period of 30 minutes or more is given by the NVS requirement specification, and therefore the second power configuration is recommended. Power use of the controller will depend on the exact configuration. The product of the 0.5 hour requirement and typical controller current draw (for a given configuration) will provide the battery bank cappacity requirement.
